<p>
This is the personal homepage of <strong>Luca Bruno</strong> <em>(aka Lethalman)</em>.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this place is to share my computer science paperworks and jobs, and keep these works collected.
</p>

<p>
As you can see I'm neither a good web designer nor English writer, though I've tried to make the website as much readable and nice as possible.
