<h1>Principles</h1>

<p>
Writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(publishing)">articles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">papers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_taking">notes</a>, <a hreF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying">surveys</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_personal_interviewing">interviews</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review">reviews</a> is important; publicly sharing them is yet more important.
Ideas and contributions are at the base of any revolution <em>(of course not my ideas)</em>.<br />
The most interesting thing is how people relates to and involves others by commenting online works, and what gets out as a result of all such writings.

<p>
From a practical view point, technical up-to-date documents are really an important resource for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">IT</a> folks, all kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hackers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_(computer_science)">home computer end-users</a>, in order to produce more, improve more, <strong>know more</strong>.

<p>
I've written most of my articles in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a>, as it's the currently the de-facto standard and most powerful way for producing and publishing personal thoughts.
